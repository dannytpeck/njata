Hello, gads and gadflys. I am Chieftain, and since we're all gathering
together under one roof I'd like to take a moment to let you know where this
is all going.
 
Through chance or mishap we have arrived in Njata, a world with a multitude
of species and histories, secrets and ruins, stories and songs. It is not
yet a big place, but hopefully it will be a fun place to play for folk
of all ages.
 
As for who I am, there is not particularly much to say. I could bore you
with the details of the incursion we recently repelled out of the
southern borders of Kidann, or explain the journey that was required to
return from the remote regions of Dogala to the rest of the world at large,
and the portents that were revealed to me during my travels there, but
these are stories to be told at the appropriate time and place.
 
This being neither know that I am, like any other sphinx, of large stature
and some marginal capability of flight. I enjoy reading of those histories
that have infected the scholars who retell it with the mad need to know
more, and to that effect keep a library full of such tomes. I am tawny of
fur and wings, and my hair is dark as my eyes.
 
Do not be deceived by my serious countenance; I am always happy to answer
questions or solve problems if I am around. Always feel free to approach me
with either if the need arises.
 
Welcome to Njata, my friends.

Hi hi! I'm Zoie the Coder, my avatar here is a slime girl, which for some of
you might be an unfamiliar thing. Imagine a big ol' pile of green ooze(in my
case!) Now reshape it like clay until it looks like a girl. Well, now you
pretty much have me!
 
Being the Coder of the MUD, anything you want done that can't already be done
will hafta go through me. I'm always open to suggestions, but they still gotta
mesh with what Chieftain is designing here! Email me at njatazoie@gmail.com if
you have suggestions/comments/bugs/etc... And thanks for being an Imm with us!

Hello! Many of you know me as Wulfen, the Builder, which is exactly what
I am here on Njata! I've been working on a guide for builders on how
to write awesome room descriptions all week, so here it is!
 
The Art of Room Describing:
Yes, there is an art to room describing, an art in which I am willing to share
my knowledge of. What I like to do is close my eyes, and imagine I'm walking
around in the area I'm describing, after maybe 2 minutes of imagining that, I
remind myself of the rules of writing descriptions, then I get going on the
description.
 
What to Put in the Room Description:
I almost always put at least 3 specific elements into a room description. The
first is what you can see in the direct vicinity around you. The second is
what you can hear/smell around you. And the third, which a lot of people leave
out, but I find is an excellent filler, is what is in the rooms around adjacent
to you.
Also, I make it a rule of thumb to have at least 4 lines in my room
descriptions.
 
The Rules of Describing Rooms:
The generally accepted rules of room describing are as follows. First, NEVER
USE
THE WORD YOU! Never ever ever. Never never...ever ever...never ever...NEVER!
There IS a good reason why this is the base rule of room describing. If you are
going to use the word you, then you're almost always going to force something
on
the player. An example I see a lot is..."You walk into the room.". That's a
huge
no-no. Bad room describer...BAD! *Hits you with a rolled up newspaper on the
nose*
What if they're flying? What if they're snake-people and they slither? What if
they got shot out of a cannon into the room?! As a basic rule, I never use the
word "you" when describing rooms. Rule #2- ALWAYS FOLLOW RULE #1! Rule 3, never
put weather patterns in your room descriptions. I can only think of one
exception
to this rule, but we don't have that feature on this mud, so you don't need to
worry about it. Rule 4, SPELLCHECK. Run it through a spellchecker, it's really
easy, I can give you a site that will spellcheck, you can open almost any
version
of Microsoft Word and it will spellcheck excellently. I think even Zmud will
spellcheck for you. 
If you don't spellcheck, you better be a prodigy at spelling and grammar and
punctuation, because if players see words spelled wrong, especially when they
see words spelled wrong, they will question how hard we really worked on the
mud.
I know we busted our asses through the creation process, but they don't, for
all
they know, we could have ripped areas from another mud. So remember, always
spellcheck descs!
I would like to thank Zoie for the inspiration she has provided me, and my bro
Shadwen for hauling ass! KEEP IT UP GUYS! <3
-WulfenPS- Oh yeah, and unless you have a very good reason not to, you should always
format your descriptions to make them look pretty. /f for that!
