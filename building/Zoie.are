[race], so keep in mind what that means for how you look. A [player's+

looks totally different from a [random race excluding player's race],+
after+
all! Try it. You want to [desc] whatever you look like-- that's short for+
describe-- using probably two to five lines.

Comlist   sayto $n You don't look like much of anything, yet! Books are what people+
remember, and believe me, $n, I'm the premier author around here. Now, you+
and I know what you look like in reality. It's our little secret! But how+
you want people to see you in Njata is important.
mpsleep 10
sayto $n You see, regardless of what you really look like-- you know what I+
mean! -- the way you're perceived in Njata is important. You wouldn't want+
anyone to suspect you aren't from this world, now, would you?"
mpsleep 10
sayto $n To start, tell me about your eyes, and your hair or horns or+
whatever it is you have on your head. Go on, try it. For example, I have+
[eyes] flint-dark eyes, and [hair] white, thin hair pulled back into a+
ponytail."

specific person, if you can. It'll be very important from here on out. When+
you [sayto] someone, then they know you're talking to them. It can be a+
little unclear, otherwise.
sayto $n Now, ask me how you look. You can do it by saying it to me! You+
can also [singto] me if you like; it works the same way.

Desc     This small and simple room appears to be the study of an industrious
recordskeeper. All four walls are taken up by sturdy oaken [bookshelves],
filled to bursting with leatherbound books and loose sheaves of paper.
There are no apparent exits, and the light in the room seems to be coming
from a stained-glass [mosaic] window set in the ceiling. The center of the
room is taken up by a large, stone [table] with mysterious runes carved in
its surface.

of tome one might imagine. Several books appear to be marked [History of

one especially large tome that has the name [Chieftain] scrawled along its
spine.

a massive ship sailing upon dark waves, through a violent storm. It

imagery are depictions of heroic figures of every race found in Njata.
