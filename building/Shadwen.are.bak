Desc     Coming inside a large store, there are hundreds of rolled up pieces of
parchment that seemingly float against the walls. There are also a few
floating bubble letters that form a sentence on the back wall, "The maps
will guide the way" they say. The floor is covered in a mysterious kind of
sand. It glistens in the light from the floating candles. The sweet scent
of tree sap lingers in the air. A perky female fairy zips across the room,
tending to the customers.
