Brutus will hand you a good starting set. The races of Njata have diverse
body types and thus have different equipment requirements. Some dont even 
have FEET! These items should fit any race and class, but keep that in
mind when travelling the world. When you are ready to try on what Brutus
has given you, [wear armor] will allow you to put on the armor, [wear
cloak] will allow you to don the cloak, and so on. The backpack is a
special type of item called a container. Try storing the waterskin in your
backpack now with  [put waterskin backpack]. When you grow thirsty, you
can [get waterskin backpack] to retrieve it, and [drink waterskin] to take
a drink. Proceed to the north when you are ready to learn more.

Desc     Now that you know about the out-of-character communication channels, it's
time to learn about the channels used for in-character communication. To
speak to an entire room of people, you need only [Say] your message. Some
jolly people may prefer to [Sing] their message instead, however. To
direct your message to a specific person while still allowing the whole

[Whisper] to a person and they will be the only one to hear your message.
If you really need to get the attention of people nearby, you can [Yell]
what you want to say. Yelling, while rude in some situations, can be very
useful to get the message across a longer distance than merely saying it.
