Desc     This extremely clear pond is safe to drink from and swim in, and is 
regarded with a mix of fear and relief. It is a wellspring of freshwater, 
on which the villagers rely on. There are rumors going around that
something supernatural has been happening to the pond. Some say
that it only happens on a full moon just as it's rising once ever three 
months. Others say that it happens once every two. The one thing
that everyone agrees on is that what ever it is it's coming from the pond

Desc     Welcome to section one of the Underground Labyrinth. As you enter 
this section you notice that the water just seems to stop at the entrance.
As if there was a magical barrier stopping the water. You also notice
that it is really dry in here. As you look around it appears that there 
is something ever odd about this place. But, you can't seem put your
finger on it, (hypothetically of course!).
