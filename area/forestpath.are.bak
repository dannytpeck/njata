Pieces of rotting flesh and decaying bone are strewn about the ground.
Something really disgusting must live down here.  There are scratches
on the wall.

powerful to make these marks.   Whatever lives down here probably does
not want to be disturbed.  Make sure you're up to the challenge before
you go any further.

Okay here is my second area.   This Area represents more of a
'realistic fantasy' rather than an 'epic fantasy' setting.

This area is a path to go from one area to another, but is a
bit too dangerous to probably be considered a linkage area.

Note that some of the mobs have Rand_progs for them attacking
rather than being outright aggressive, both to suprise
experienced players and give newbies more a chance to
determine combat.

ExDesc       This represents an old trade route, made unusable by the
Bandit Eric and his group.

Along the main path the players meet the Knight Theggory.
He tells of seeking a druid. 
The Druid tells of needing to help the forest as it isn't as
healthy as it seems, so he seeks the guardian of the forest a
dryad.
The Dryad says that she has been driven from her tree by
humans, she needs the Heart of the Tree to regain her home.
The Tree is the base Erics Band and entry is hard to find
without talking to the Dryad, deep in the tree is the 
heart for which the dryad will reward the return of.
