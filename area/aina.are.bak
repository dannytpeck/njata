conditions evident all along the length of the street. Merchants and traders
yell out from the doorways of their shops or from the front of their carts
selling items that you couldn't imagine anyone wanting. A toothpick made
from the wood of the morgaz jungle is for sale at one cart, said to heal
the poison of the Muanga Beetle, while in another shop you can see a jar
filled with what appears to be newt's legs, the shopkeeper announcing to
all that they are the prime ingredients for a spell of protection against
the bite of a Greater Blood Beetle.

and crossbones. The room to the east is behind a locked door of iron.
Upon the door, is an intricate locking mechanism that looks like it
is missing a circular piece of it. Whatever is behind that door, the
smugglers are wanting to keep locked up and safe.

Desc     The leader of the smugglers has obviously picked through the
best of the booty to get the items to decorate his office. 
Ornate oil lamps hang from the walls which have been paneled 
in a dark wood paneling. Upon the floor a large intricately
woven tapestry rug lies covering up the stone floor. An 
elaborately carved oaken desk and chair sit at the northern
section of the room and an enormous map of the coastline
hangs upon the western wall.

anyone who would want to try to steal the smuggler's booty. 
Situated all throughout the room are spoils taken from visiting
ships and from warehouses of this and other cities. Items
stored in this room include weapons, fabrics, spices, gold, and
most any other item of value that the smugglers can sell.

a very musty odor to it, and is filled with dust and debris that
has been stirred up from the intrusion. A faint light is coming
from the north, further down the passage.

Desc     It looks like this room hasn't been visited in many years. A
fine layer of dust covers what few objects are lying around,
an old box that looks like it was used as a table and some 
broken wood that might have been a chair in a former life that
is piled up in the corner. An exit from this room is through the
wall to the south.
