Desc     You have just entered the Caverns of the Forgotten Kings. As 
you look around you notice that the cavern has no light source. 
You also hear the continuous sound of  [dripping]  water. The
Caverns has a damp and musty smell to it like it hasn't seen 
the light of day in over a generation. It appears that the 
caverns have been recently , attacked due to pieces of the [sarcophagi] lying
on the floor in front of you As you look at the wall there is a [plaque] that
has been nailed into it.

Welcome to the Caverns of the  Forgotten Kings. The names of the Kings have
been lost. And for the most port so have the Caverns that housed them.
People don't actually know the name of this place so it and most of its
history has almost been entirely forgotten. Hence the name Forgotten
Caverns. Journey on word my fellow adventurer and see what history  these
Caverns house for you. 
 
Be Warn tho everyone who entered before you has never come bacK!!!!!

continues to  [drip]  and the musty moldy smell seems to be getting worse.
That is probably due to the mold that is growing on ceiling in

Desc     You have finally entered the heart of the caverns. The
drippings seems to have stopped for some reason. As you look
around, this place was once rich with artifacts. But, due to this
place being here for thousands of years, graverobbers have taken
everything of value.

Desc     This was once the room to the most important king. or so the story goes, 
now it just a bland broken room with a door leading to thetreasure room. 
Apparently this room is no longer home to the body of the king now it's the
throne room to the necromanser that now
inhabites the place. 
From which he orders his minions to do his bidding for him... 
Some of which are living breathing creatures some are just reanimated bodies of
the king.

Desc     After laying the kings and covering up the main enterance into 
the caverns. This room was used as the only way out. The room 
is surrounded by shelves. That may or may not have ever been
coverd by things. tho one can assume so since there are broken
 [vases]  on the floor. you notice yet another  [plaque]  nailed to the 
wall in this room.

Congratulation! on killing the evil vial monster.  As you can probably
guess at this point I lied. I write this because i wrote in the past that
no one has ever made it out of here alive. Well, how can that be if you
have been reading the various plaques that have been scattered though
out.. At some point you had to think to yourself, how can thses be up if
no one has lived. By the way, the ladder  you see behind you takes you
back  to the enterance. so that being the only way out if the main  
enterance is blocked is totally not real. Tho like everything else in
here. No one actually knows what happened. For the kings where buried over
1000 years and no one wrote   who they were, why they were buryed here or
how this place  Was built..
