The ruins of the Haranian desert have been grievously overlooked by
scholars for centuries, without any clear explanation. I believe I
now know why; the heat of the desert and the sheer loneliness is
enough to drive anyone away.
 
And yet, I am confident that there is a discovery to be made here.
Little is known about these scattered ruins, except that once they
were the backbone of some great civilisation.
 
There is not much left, I am disheartened to say, but I have found
traces of some ancient, coppery metal, which I belive give added
credibility to my theory that the founders of this place were also
the creators of the bronze men that inhabit the copper dunes. I have
been unable to enter that particular part of the desert because those
rusting guardians always chase me away, but I did manage to obtain
a small sample of the strange sand and I hope to match it with the
metal sample I discovered.
 
What were the reasons behind the metal monstrosities? I will continue
my search in the hopes that I might find out more soon.

I can think of little else except my quest. All my thoughts and dreams
and desires are centred on this one thing, this overwhelming need. I
must find what I seek or go mad in the search. Even in sleep I cannot
escape the grasp of this obsession that has taken me!
 
Long it took me to seek the location of fabled Moram-El, but in those
dangerous, dusty halls, I found signs, words that spoke of an even
greater treasure. The greatest city there ever was.
 
Legend tells us of how the Moram, in ages past remembrance, ruled this
world with an iron fist. There were few to stand against them, such was
their power. But in their pride and arrogance, they were destroyed, and
in so doing, destroyed what was, and what would be.
 
I have searched now for what seems a lifetime, scouring the sands of
the desert until I choked on it. But the place is vast, unfathomable,
and the secret has remained a secret for centuries, even to the nomads
who make their home here. What chance have I to find the place, when
none before me have succeeded?
 
Ahh, but I must keep trying, for my sanity and my glory. Beneath my
feet, somewhere, lies treasure beyond reckoning. I have the word of
entry, if only I could find the entrance!

ExDesc       The password I have marked here, in the old tongue, so that I may
remember it in days to come. I have no fear that others might find this
book and discover the secret, for there are few now who can read the
old tongue, and fewer still who would care to learn.
 
The Hawk, the Volcano, The Bloodied Eye, The Dragon, The Crimson Wyvern,
The Axe, The Bloodied Eye and the Troll.
 
I must return to my work now, for the day draws to a close and there is
so much still to do.

Desc     The great walls of the City of Phatep stand to the north of here,
rising up on either side of the massive wooden gates and encircling
the entire city. Guards in strange-looking, conical helmets patrol
the top of the walls, watching the lands beyond the city limits for
signs of danger. In all other directions - south, west and east -
lies the vast, seemingly endless expanse of the Great Haranian desert.
The sands glow in the sun and the air seems to ripple in the heat.
There are no trails through the desert, and all directions look much
the same. Far to the east of here, the faint, barely discernible outline
of the Kithan Mountains rise up against the horizon, pale blue against
the background and wreathed in a fine blanket of mist.

a black shape against the blacker darkness of the night. Warmly
glowing lights illuminate the tops of the walls, where guards patrol
night and day, watching the surrounding lands for signs of danger.
Two tall towers topped with minarets frame the wide, strong-looking
gates and soft, pale moonlight bathes the town in a pearl-like glow.
To the south, east and west stretches the endless sands of the Great
Desert. The normally golden sands are now a gentle silver, like a sea
of molten metal. To the far east, the Kithan mountains are framed
against the starry sky like powerful black sentinels, watching over
the desert and the city.

here, completely surrounding the city to protect it from attack and
from the harsh environment of the desert. The seemingly endless sands
stretch away like a vast sea of golden-brown as far as the eye can
see to the south. To the east, it runs up to the very edge of the
great Kithan Mountain range. A few small date trees stand up close
to the wall, but not high enough that an enemy could use them to
gain access to the interior of Phatep. The gates stand someway west
of here.

in a soft, pearly radience. A tall tower rears up out of dunes of
sand that have piled up high around the base. The stone seems to
shimmer silver in the moonlight, as though made from metal instead
of the rough stone. The broken, crumbling shell of a toppled minaret
lies near to the tower, little more than a cracked shell. More
ruins lie to the east and west of the tower, while the seemingly
endless Haranian desert extends out in all other directions.

across this are of desert like a giant's discarded toys. A huge stone
head that is cracked and broken and crumbling into rubble, lies half
submerged in the sand; only and eye and part of the nose remains in

spirits of the long ago inhabitants still roam. The ruins extend

as though alive. A huge stone head lies half submerged in the sand

it. The stone is golden, like the desert, and the structures must once
have been incredible to look at. Time has taken its toll, however, and
there is little here now but broken columns and crumbling statues with
little remaining above the sand. Beyond the ruins to the west, in the
distance, the desert comes to an end at a long line of jagged rocks,
beyond which lies the sparkling blue of the ocean. The desert lies
past the ruins to the east, north and south.

with the soft, pearly radience of the moon. It is obvious that the
ruins have been here for a great many years; the stone is rough and
crumbling, and the desert sands have consumed many of the structures,
burying them beneath heaped dunes. More ruines lie to the east, while

Desc     This is a small oasis, made up of a single, tiny pool of refreshing water,
sitting like a mirage in the middle of the sand. Amazingly, green grass
grows at the poolside, the ground fed by the water so that it becomes
fertile. A single palm tree overlooks the oasis, offering shade during
the daylight hours. There is also a shelf like rock jutting out over the
water, providing a place to rest and relax.

the grass at the poolside, and the gentle tinkling of the waters against

mark the path east into what looks like a small but bustling nomad camp.
Dull brown, semi-permanent huts known as yurts and a jumble of red and
orange tents form the bulk of the camp. A flag pole bearing a fluttering
banner has been stuck in the ground at the edge of the path showing a
picture of a racing camel and the word Alari. To the north and west lies
the unchanging vastness of the Haranian desert.

other animals native to Haran hang from the walls, along with unusual
items that do not seem to have any recognisable purpose. The entire
room is filled with a faint mist that emanates from various candles
scaterred across the floor, and the smell is intoxicating. There is
a circular pit dug in the centre of the room for a fire, and a hole in
the roof allows the smoke to escape. The only door from the yurt is

Desc     This is the edge of the Alari camp. The sand has been clearing to create
a large space infront of the council tent that stands to the south. West of
here is the oasis, which provides fruit and water for the Alari tribe.
The main part of the camp stands to the east, surrounded by a cluster of
tents and semi-permanent huts known as Yurts

few shafts of eerie, silver moonlight to illuminate the area. A large

the flap, casting dancing shadows across the canvas walls. There is an

Desc     The interior of this large tent is dark and somewhat dingy due to the
thin mist of grey smoke that issues up from the various hubble bubble
pipes and scented candles that are ranged across the floor. A large,
cushioned divan rests against the far wall and the floor around the
divan is covered in velvet pillows. The centre of the tent has been
hollowed out and a large bath has been sunken into the ground. The
water looks refreshing against the heat of the desert, and the smooth
surface is scattered with rose petals. The tent flap is to the north.

mat and colourful hides hang from the walls as decoration. Low, wooden
benches form a half circle at the far end of the room, partly surrounding
a table that fills up the middle of the tent. Lamps hang from the walls
and the central support that cuts through the middle of the table. The
only way out of the tent is through the flap on the north wall.

Great Haran Desert that stretch away to the north and west. Palm trees
grow tall, swaying in the breeze and overhanging a sparkling oasis of
crystal clear water. A large pillar of rock rises up in the centre of
the pool, entwined with green vines that look out of place even in this
beautiful place. A grove of date trees offer shade to the south of
here and the Alari nomad's camp is to the east.

scattered among the spikes of rock where ships have run aground on
the treacherous coast in the past. To the east, pale moonlight
slants down, flshing on the sands that are golden brown during the

of the city of Phatep stand just north of the desert sands, and they
are lit with dim oil lamps that hang from the top of the battlements.

here is extremely hazardous and one wrong foot or a slip could mean
instant death by impalement on any of the many spears of stone. The
sands of the desert expand eastwards into the far distance, like a sea
of gold, sparkling in the bright light of the sun. Some way west, beyond
the Teeth, lies the endless waters of the ocean, sunsparkled and gleaming
like a carpet of diamonds.

of this barrier of rocks that seperates the desert from the waters of
the ocean some way west. If anything, the shimmering glow of the moon
adds a surreal, sinister aspect to the unturned spears of stone. Walking

wasp nest. The nest is oval shaped and a slightly darker shade of yellow
than the sand it rests on. Circular openings all around the nest allow
entry and exit to the wasps. A loud, constant buzzing echoes from within
the structure. To the east and northeast there is nothing but sand. To the
west is a massive rocky ridge blocking any further travel in that direction.
The crashing of the ocean waves can just be heard from beyond the ridge,
barely discernible over the sound of the wasps.

ExDesc       Moonlight illuminates a huge pile of sand that has been massed into
an immense dune. The sand gleams like silver and shifts gently under
the weight of a huge, oval shaped wasp's nest that is perched on the
summit. Like everything else in the desert at night, the nest is little
more than a blob of darkness, surrounded by a pale, pearly glow from
the moon and starlight. A loud, constant buzz echoes from within the
nest, and darker circles can just be seen where the wasps enter and
exit. In most directions there is nothing but desert, but any travel
to the west is blocked by a massive ridge of stone. The sound of waves
crashing against rock can be heard from beyond the barrier, indicating
that the ocean is hidden just out of view.

Desc     This is a narrow, sand-covered trail that follows the wall of the
City of Phatep to the north, in the direction of the city gates, and
south, towards the heart of the Great Desert that stretches away into
the horizon. More of the desert extends east from here, before meeting
up with the Kithan mountain ranges some distance away. The walls of
Phatep are huge and impossing, and look more than capable of deterring
any invaders.

Stats    0 10 0
Desc     This is a narrow trail, half-buried beneath the sands of the desert,
that follows the eastern wall of Phatep as it runs in a north-south
direction. The sands of the desert stretch away from here to the east
and south, but it has been somewhat tamed here near the city and a
grove of palm and date trees grow nearby in the shade of the wall.
Further east, past the borders of the desert, lie the high peaks of
the Kithan Mountain Range.

Desc     A clump of boulders sit off to the side of the trail here, offering a
limited shade during the day. A palm tree grows in amongst the clump
casting a shadow over the wall of the City of Phatep that stands to
the west and runs north and south. The path follows the wall north
as far as the gates and also south, where it eventually merges with
the sands of the Great Desert.

Desc     This is the start of what appears to be a small merchant train. Despite
the fact that trains through the desert are intended to make the journey
quicker, this one does not appear to be moving. The sand has been cleared
and several tents have been pitched, making this a semi permanent camp.
There is no sign of water nearby however and only a few stunted palm
trees seem to offer any kind of shade.

Desc     This is the central portion of a merchant caravan. Here things look a
little settled and a number have tents have been pitched for shelter.
It is a very exposed part of the desert and there is little shade or
protection from the elements to be found, making it a poor choice for
a campsite. The end of the caravan is to the east and the front is to
the west.

Desc     This is the rear end of the merchant caravan. Empty crates, boxes,
and sacks lie scattered across the sand. Some are still full, but
they are far fewer than the full ones. Barrels also stand among the
empty packaging, and these most likely contain water. The main part
of the merchant caravan is to the west. In all other directions there
is nothing but sand.

Desc     Though larger than most, this tent is still fairly small, and obviously
not meant to be used as a permanent abode. The interior is a mass of
scattered boxes and parchments. A large matress occupies the far wall
and a makeshift desk sits in the middle of the room, made from the wood
of several palm trees. The only way out of the tent is through a flap on
the north wall.

Desc     A large outcropping of rocks forms the base for a huge mass of leaves
and stones and twigs all mashed together and covered in a sticky resin
to create a nest. A few scattered bones of desert creatures lie in a
scattered jumble around the base of the rocks. Blood splatters cover
some of the stones, turning them an ugly, dull red. The smell is
terrible, bringing to mind death and decay. To the south and southwest
is the golden, gleaming sands of the great desert.

Desc     Strange, heaped dunes of copper coloured sand extends south and east
from here, stretching some distance. The grains of sand seem thicker,
almost like rust and there is a strange smell in the air, like ancient
metal. Walking on the sand is more difficult than normal, making travel
slower and more tiring. There are no trees or any other form of life in
view. The normal, golden sands of the desert stretch away to the west
from here.

a glow over the mounds of unusual sand that are heaped up here. The
sand seems to swallow the light, and glow with an eerie, fire-like
quality that is unnerving and surreal. Nothing seems to grow in this
section of the desert and there is an ominous silence over everything.
The sands to the west of here seem closer to normal and are suffused
a silvery sparkle from the moon and stars.

touching it seems inclined to sink deeply below the surface and not
want to come out again. The coppery coloured dunes shift constantly
into new shapes and sizes, even into near mountains of firey red
look almost impossible. The strange dunes continue to the south east

Desc     These strange, copper coloured dunes of heaped sand make a strange
clanking sound as they shift beneath their own weight. It is a
disconcerting feeling, and the sound is not pleasant. Walking on
the dunes is very difficult as it does not seem firmly packed like
the rest of the desert, and any weight sinks deep below the surface.
The dunes continue to the south and west.

mournful and quiet. The coppery sands extend to the north, east and

when the wind whistles across the sand and distorts it, making it sound
for all the world like the wail of a banshee, or some other lost soul in
pain and torment. It is an ominous, eerie sound, made all the more disturbing
by the unusual surroundings that glow a deep crimson in the light of the
moon. The desert continues to the north, south, east and west, though
the coppery dunes go no further west.

several spans high. The pole is rusting and weathered, but still
seems capable of bearing a great deal of punishment from the elements.
It is an odd sight to see among the sands of the desert, but strangely
acceptable against the metalic, copper coloured dunes.

metallic quality and they crunch underfoot with a loud ringing sound.
Nothing seems to grow among the dunes, and there is no living thing

Desc     This is the interior of a huge wasp nest. A constant, echoing buzz
rebounds around the room, filling the air. There is a strong smell
covering everything, but it is unidentifiable. The only way out is
the same way as coming int, through one of the small holes high on
the walls of the nest.

Desc     There are a few patches of yellow, stunted grass stalks growing at the
side of the path here, where the desert is beginning to taper to an
end further north. The trail follows the desert and the Walls of Phatep
to the north and south. Some distance north, the gates of the city can
just be seen, and in the distance, to the east, stands the great peaks
of the Kithan Mountain range.

merge with the soft golden sands of the desert that strange away to the

sink down below the surface. Nothing grows here and there are nor rocks
or living things to be seen.

ExDesc       Strange, copper coloured dunes rise and fall like waves in the sea to
the north and east of here, and merge with the more normal looking,
golden coloured sands of the Great Desert that stretch away to the west.
Soft moonlight lies like a blanket over everything, and though they
give some small illumination over the sands to the west, they cause
the coppery dunes to glow with a strong, firey red.

Desc     Three unusual metal pyramids, some two spans high, rise up from the
coppery sands of the desert, like ancient black monoliths. There does
not appear to be any sign of rust or wear on the unusual objects, and
the harsh environment of the desert seems to have little effect on them.
Each of the them are topped with a small cone of shimmering quartz that
captures the sunlight and sends it glittering outwards in thousands of
small, bright shafts of white.

ExDesc       Three black, metal pyramids, each some two spans high, rise up from the
curious coppery sands of the desert. They look like ancient black
monoliths, though they show no signs of wear or rust, despite being
built in the middle of a harsh desert environment. Each pyramid is
topped with a tiny cone of quartz. Each cone seems to absorb the light
and refract it up into the night sky, but the central one sends a single,
strong beam of light down so that is strikes the sand directly infront
of it.

Desc     By the light filtering in through the crack in the wall,
it can be seen that this cave is not very large. There are
signs that this cave has been used in the recent past.
A burnt out fire is in a pit in the corner and what looks
like the bone remains of a meal are littered on the ground.
Perhaps this small cave provides shelter for those caught
in the desert when one of the frequent dust storms flair up.

Desc     A few prickly cactus grow close to the trail here, near where some of
the waste water from Phatep flows out through a small culvert in the
bottom of the wall. The water, although adding some small nourishment
to the earth is brakish and not pleasant to smell. The walls of the
city run north to the gates, and south to the southeastern corner of
the city.

Desc     Loose rocks and grit litter this narrow trail, indicating that the
relatively loose sands of the desert are gradually fading away to be
replaced by the rocky ground of the mountains that stand to the east.
The walls of the City of Phatep run on a north and south line here,
alongside the trail. The gates stand some distance to the north.

Desc     Yellow, fading grass verges this sandy trail, and a grove of palm trees
stand not far from the path, casting a welcome shade. To the west stands
the tall, thick walls of the City of Phatep. The sounds of the city can
be plainly heard, drifting over the walls as a general hubbub. The
gates to the city are a short distance north of here, while the trail
continues to the south, eventually merging into the sands of the desert.

Desc     Just north of here, this sandy trail merges with the larger, more worn
trail that leads away from the city east, and up into the Kithan
Mountain range. The gates can be seen clearly from here, and they
stand tall and sturdy between two tall towers topped with the dome-like
minarets that are popular among the people of Haran. The sands of the
desert expand south and east from here, and the trail follows the walls
of the city south until it eventually merges with the desert sands.

Desc     This is a dark, underground cavern that glows with a faint coppery light.
Metal shards pierce the ceiling in many places, some of them reaching
almost to the sandy floor below. The stone walls are silent and cold
and not even the sound of dripping water breaks the ominous quiet.
There is a circular opening in the ceiling. It is small and covered
in a thick mat of sand the is packed tight, stopping it from falling
through. Tunnels lead from here to the north, south, east and west.

Desc     A Pair of thick copper doors stand to the north of here, blocking any
further progress in that direction. There are no handles on the doors
and no obvious way through. A curly, smooth engraving decorates both
halves of the door, and small, gently glowing jewels are embedded in
the edges. The walls of this small passage glow with a dim copper colour,
as though the walls are filled with metal. The passage leads south into
a large central chamber.

Desc     Any futher passage to the south is blocked by a pair of semi-circular
bronze doors that block the entire tunnel. The surface of the doors are
engraved with curious designs that consists of swirls and circles in
intricate detail. Small gems are imprinted into the metal around the
edges and these glow with a soft inner light. The tunnel leads back
to the north, where it merges with the large central chamber.

Desc     This small passage ends quite abruptly here at a wall of solid rock.
The rock is embedded with what appears to be copper ingots, that glow
with some inner light. It is cold down here in the tunnels, but it is
not moist, perhaps due to the incredible heat of the desert above. The
tunnel runs west from here, into the main portions of the cave.

Desc     This is a large, spherical chamber that has been hollowed out of the
solid rock. The floor is sandy and littered with loose rocks and stones.
A passage leads east, back into the central part of the cave. Any further
progress to the west is blocked by a large rockfall that completely
blocks the tunnel. A tiny gap between two of the large boulders shows
a dark passage leading on behind the blockage but there is no way of
reaching it.

Desc     The view from the top of Demons Tor is spectacular. The golden sands of the
desert can be seen extending off in all directions as far as the eye can
see. Situated to the southeast, what looks to be some sort of temple or
shrine can be seen on the horizon. Heading to the west can get to the other
end of the rock, or the rock can be climbed back down to the desert floor.
