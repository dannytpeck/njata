ExDesc       You are about to enter the Tomb of Damara. Damara was an ancient
wizard that fought for good. At his castle, he guarded the Orb of
Dragonkind to make sure it wouldn't fall into evil hands. After he
died, many heroes tried to find the Orb, but no one ever did.
The castle is now in ruins and filled with danger.
 
*WARNING*: The following area was designed for levels 15-25. Enter at
           your own risk.
 
This area was built by Gabriel Androctus for The Apocalypse Theatre.
It is based heavily upon the map in the "Introduction to AD&&D" kit.
It has been changed slightly, but the original work is not my own.

There is an eerie presence in this room as though something is
watching... waiting. The only exit is through the door you came in.

along with bones, bits of stale bread, and moldy cheese.

Desc     As you enter the room, the foul stench of death overwhelms you. Mangled
corpses of what you assume used to be servants lie on the ground,
apparently part of some creature's main course. There is a makeshift
bed against the northern wall made up of piles of furs. Against the
wall beside the bed lies a plain, wooden chest.

mysteriously light. A large, intricate throne lies against the far
wall engraved with runes in some ancient tongue. On either side of
the throne are clay pots engraved with the same runes.
